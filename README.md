# TQS_ProjetoFinal
Projeto Final da Cadeira de Testes e Qualidade de Software 2023/2024

## The project:
The aim of our system, **DETICafe**,  is to provide an easier, faster and contactless delivery for students in
university, specifically DETI students, who don't always like communicating with others.
Our system will help digitalize this project and provide a contactless delivery, which means, the customer
will rarely have to talk with the waiter.
Our system its compose by **4 different interfaces**. It will function in a way that the customer makes the order at the kiosk interface, and when they pay, the order is sent to the kitchen interface. There, the cook can see the order's specific requests and possible alterations in order to cook it. When the status is done, the cook sends a signal to
the waiter dashboard for him to pick it up. When the order is at the pickup spot, the waiter changes the
status in the order display interface, so that the customer can pick it up.
The main difference from other similar well known products is the fact that our system will makr
life easier, not only for the bar workers but especially for DETI students who don’t have the time to wait
in waiting line for their order. Using our application they will be able to previously place their order and
only get them when they are ready for pick up. Also during the ordering process, this is separated into
different sections, enabling a customer to order from a cafeteria, pastery or even restaurant, etc., making
the process easier and quicker.
